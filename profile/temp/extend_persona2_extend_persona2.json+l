Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.\\n\\n# What does a moderator do?\\n\\nModerators here at\\xa0[r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/)\\xa0work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.\\n\\n# What are the minimum requirements to apply?\\n\\nIf you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the\\xa0r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.\\n\\nIf this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you\\xa0[check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)\\n\\n# What are the expectations for users who join the\\xa0r/Anxiety moderation team?\\n\\nWe need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.\\n\\n# Anything I should know before I apply?\\n\\nYes,\\xa0[r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/)\\xa0is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.\\n\\nOur team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it,\\xa0*but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.\\n\\nIf you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.\\n\\nNo one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.\\n\\nSecond, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).\\n\\n# How do I apply?\\n\\nIf you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:\\n\\n1. Send us a\\xa0[modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety)\\xa0indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:\\n   * What does mental health mean to you?\\n   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on\\xa0r/Anxiety ?\\n   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?\\n2. We will review your\\xa0[modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety)\\xa0and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.\\n3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.\\n4. New moderators on the\\xa0r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.\\n\\nThanks for reading, and we hope you apply!\", 'current_state': 'pre-contemplation', 'attitude': 'Skeptical', 'referred_by(input)': 'self-referred', 'problems': 'Client exhibits chronic anxiety which impacts daily interactions and decision-making abilities.', 'problems in short': 'Chronic anxiety', 'reason_for_counseling': 'Began experiencing overwhelming levels of stress and was encouraged to seek help.', 'referred_by': 'self-referred', 'events': ['Frequent arguments with family members over minor issues due to heightened stress levels.', 'Avoidance of social gatherings with friends, leading to friends feeling distanced and misunderstood.', 'Tension with colleagues at work due to perceived lack of engagement and enthusiasm.', 'Experienced a panic attack during a work presentation, leading to embarrassment and further anxiety.', 'Increased reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism for stress, causing concern among family and friends.', 'Loss of sleep due to excessive worry about future responsibilities and personal obligations.', 'Significant conflict with a close friend who felt ignored and unsupported during their own time of need.', 'Withdrawn behavior and isolation from peers, leading to feelings of loneliness and sadness.', 'Difficulty maintaining romantic relationships due to inability to manage stress effectively.', 'Considered leaving current job due to overwhelming anxiety and feeling inadequate for the role.']}\n\nTask:\n1) For each MI stage \u2014 Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, Preparation \u2014 choose **exactly 1 or 2** resistance type codes (e.g., PC1, CO2, PR3) that this client is likely to exhibit.  \n2) **List the chosen codes in the order they are expected to emerge** within that stage (earlier resistance first).  \n3) If there is **no resistance** for a stage, return that stage\u2019s neutral code as a single-element list: [\"PC0\"], [\"CO0\"], or [\"PR0\"].  \n4) If the client\u2019s starting stage is **Contemplation**, set \"pre-contemplation\" to an **empty list** (`[]`).  \n5) Base every choice and its brief reason on the persona details.  \n6) Return **only** the JSON object in the exact format below\u2014no extra keys, explanations, or markdown.\n\nAvailable resistance types (codes only):\nPre-Contemplation:\nName :  Description\n-------------------------\nProblem-Acknowledged : Recognizes the existence of a problem and expresses openness to change.
